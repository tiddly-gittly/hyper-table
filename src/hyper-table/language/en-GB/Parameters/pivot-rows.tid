The configuration items have slight differences according to the headerType. The supported headerTypes are: 'text' | 'link' | 'image' | 'video'
example: Configuration is complex, see the official documentation for details. However, it is possible to use a simple array of strings to indicate which fields in the data are to be used, e.g. ['title']
